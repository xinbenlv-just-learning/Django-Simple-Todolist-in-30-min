Trouble shooting:
  [PROBLEM]Once installed, List and Item didn't show up in the admin
  [SOLUTION]
    Some updated for Django 1.0.2
    1) use max_length instead of maxlength
    2) remove 'class Admin pass'
    and replace it with a new admin.py in todo
    directory that has
    -------
    from django.contrib import admin
    from models import List
    from models import Item
    admin.site.register(List)
    admin.site.register(Item)
    -------
